/* Custom Robo game data, written by tools/gen_data_c.py; regenerate it, do not edit (python -I tools/gen_data_c.py --all).
 * A data-only game unit (plan.md step 86, docs/decomp.md "Game data objects"): .bss 0x803B76E8-0x803B8BE8, 1 object, linked from this file (batch 9: retail SHA-1, objdiff 100%, shift test).
 * Types: symbols/cr_types.h (through the drafts' context), names and addresses: symbols/cr_globals.txt; zero-initialised, as main.dol has it.
 * The compiler lays .bss / .sbss out in reverse declaration order, so the definitions are in that order:
 *   0x803B76E8 lbl_803B76E8 (u8[5376], 0x1500 bytes), UNTYPED (symbols/bss_untyped.txt: size and place only, no reader typed it yet)
 * The game's own source files are not known: this unit is one contiguous run of its data, not the original file. */
